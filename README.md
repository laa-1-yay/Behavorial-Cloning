# Behaviorial Cloning Project
Used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The model uses an architecture consisting of 5 CNN, 4 Fully Connected Layers with 2 Dropout Layers.

Simulator is used to steer a car around a track for data collection. Image data and steering angles were used to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The project has five main files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car )
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* report.md (Description of the project) 
* video.mp4 (a video recording of vehicle driving autonomously around the track )

Watch video of autonomous driving here : https://youtu.be/dQ7-mqbLmZU    



The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Approach and summary

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nvidia. I thought this model might be appropriate because of it was already used in solving similar problems.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model with :
* More augmented data of anti clockwise driving
* Flipped images with corresponding steering angles
* Used dropout layers

Then I trained the model.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. 

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 1. Architecture Description


My model Uses deep convolutional neural network that takes images captured by the 3-cameras in the simulator and returns the steering angles. I used the Nvidia architecture as shown below:

 I then modified the architecture. 
 Difference was in cropping layer and dropout layers.
 
 Here's a detailed description of the model layers I used:


| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 160x320x3 BGR image           | 
| cropping          | Output 80x320x3               |
| Lambda            | Normalization                  |
| Convolution 5x5   | 2x2 stride, depth 24  	|
| RELU				    	|	Activation											|
| Convolution 5x5   | 2x2 stride, depth 36	|
| RELU				    	|	Activation											|		
| Convolution 5x5   | 2x2 stride, depth 48 	|
| RELU				    	|	Activation											|
| Convolution 3x3   |  depth 64	|
| RELU				    	|	Activation											|
| Convolution 3x3   |  depth 64 	|
| RELU				    	|	Activation											|
| Flatten   	    	| Flatten  o/p of last conv layer	|		
| Dropout Layer 		| Probability - 0.5    |
| Fully connected		| Dense,  Output = 100    |
| Fully connected		| Dense,  Output = 50    |
| Dropout Layer 		| Probability - 0.5    |
| Fully connected		| Dense,  Output = 10    |
| Fully connected		| Dense,  Output = 1    |
|						|												|
|						|												|
 


I used 5- convolutional layers followed a flatten layer, then 4- fully connected layers and 2 dropout layers in between.

My model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer. 

#### 3. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

* For regularization, the model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting after first layer of flatten and before fully connected layer with output 10. 

* Early termination was done at 15th epoch as validation loss started increasing afterwards

* More augmented data of anti clockwise driving and lipped images with corresponding steering angles was added.

* The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting.

The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 4. Model parameter tuning

The model parameters are tuned as following. The Adam optimizer is used, the rate is set with default value. No learnig rate is required.

Keras's Generator was used to feed batch data as an when required, so that all data does not have to be stored in the Memory. 

epochs = 15  
batch_size = 32   
loss = mse   
optimizer = adam   
train/ test split = 20%
   
#### 5. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of folowing data:

* two or three laps of center lane driving
* one lap of recovery driving from the sides
* one lap focusing on driving smoothly around curves
* one lap of recovery data with anti clock wise direction
* one lap of center and smooth data in anti clock wise direction

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here are example images of different cameras: 

center camera

![alt text][image8]

left camera

![alt text][image9]

right camera

![alt text][image10]


These cameras have will give different steering angles as shown :

![alt text][image2]

Correction was done by subtracting 0.2 from right and adding 0.2 to left camera image steering angle data

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to drive to the center from the sides. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from right :

To augment the data set, I also flipped images and angles (steering measurements) thinking that this would increase data and prevent underfitting. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image8]                      ![alt text][image11]

After the collection process, I had 1048576 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by :
* Cropping the unecessary portions : eg. mountains and sky
* cropping the bottom hood of the car   

the above just makes the network harder to train and adds confusion.

* CV2 opens image in BGR format. So, I changed it to RGB first.


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model.   
The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting.   
The ideal number of epochs was 15 as evidenced by validation and training loss decreasing till 15th e poch and then increasing.   
I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
